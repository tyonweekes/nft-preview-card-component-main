## My process

### Built with

- CSS variables
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

- How to create hover states
- How to create a semi-transparent overlay with an image on top
- How to position an image within a relatively-positioned element
- Practiced Flexbox some more here
- How to group items within divs for styling purposes
- How to style an hr element
- How to add a border to a circular image
- Reinforced how to overwrite styles (links in this case)

### Continued development

I would like to refine how to center items, as there may be a more efficient way. I'm still interested in practicing responsive code and JavaScript more. Wordpress is also something that I think would be helpful to know.

### Useful resources

- [Stack Overflow - Add Border to Circle Image](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16310985/add-border-to-circle-image) - This helped me learn how to add a border to a circular image.

- [Rapid Tables - HSL to RGB Converter](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/color/hsl-to-rgb.html) - This is a good website for HSL to RGB color conversion.

- [Wisdm Labs - Show Color Overlay Image Hover Using CSS](https://wisdmlabs.com/blog/show-color-overlay-image-hover-using-css/) - This taught me how to do cover overlays. Very helpful, would recommend.
